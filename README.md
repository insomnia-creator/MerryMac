# m-cli-gui
An upgraded version of M-CLI, for use from the Menu bar! This is a quick and easy way to do all the things M-CLI has to offer, but from the comfort of the Menu Bar.


When will it release?

Soon enough, I'm doing my best!

This will support the application as a Tray Icon.

# Notice:
Some functions might not be included as they're just better off from the command line, upcoming updates might contradict this though, what I'm going to do right now is get a working build up!
